# StackathonChromeExtension

### About the project:
##### This is a hackathon project I did while going through Fullstack Academy's Immersive Software Engineering coding bootcamp. For the assignment we were given three to four days to create a small project. In that time I decided I would make an extension for Google Chrome that could read a document for you. In the end I was able to create this extension, which I called Text Speak, that I now have installed on my local google chrome. There are definitely improvements that I could make to this project but I'm happy with what I have currently. If you are looking to use this extension on your own computer here's what you have to do:
<ol>
  <li>Download this repo onto your computer</li>
  <li>In Google chrome go to your extensions</li>
  <li>Click Load unpacked in the top left corner</li>
  <li>Select the repo folder for this extension</li>
</ol>
##### These steps should allow you to use Text Speak locally on your Google Chrome. In the future I might make updates, but this is what I have so far.
